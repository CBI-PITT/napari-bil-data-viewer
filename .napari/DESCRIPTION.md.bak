## Change Log:

##### <u>v0.1.2:</u>

**Fixed:** Issue where .ims files containing a single color 2D image would not open.

**Fixed:** Issue where using the widget to change resolutions while in 3D rendering would cause a crash.  Now the viewer is automatically forced into 2D rendering mode when the widget is used.

**Dependency change:** The loader is now dependent in a separate package for loading IMS files.  https://pypi.org/project/imaris-ims-file-reader/
